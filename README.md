Python (3.9+) or Typescript Backend Challenge

Task:
•	Build a RESTful api that services requests for sprocket factory data and sprockets.
•	The app should be built using either Python (3.9+) or Typescript.
•	For data retention, a database or cache can be used.
•	Ideally, use docker/docker-compose for standing up the datastore.
•	The code should be on a github repository that should be shared with your engineering contact.

Requirements:
•	RESTful Endpoints
o	An endpoint that returns all sprocket factory data ✓
o	An endpoint that returns factory data for a given factory id ✓
o	An endpoint that returns sprockets for a given id ✓
o	An endpoint that will create new sprocket ✓
o	An endpoint that will update sprocket for a given id ✓
   -  Seed data/examples of the factory and sprocket are in the attached JSON files
   -  Include a README with instructions on how to stand up the database and application
